[b] ModJam Vol. 2 focuses on CHARACTERS, rather than items! We present a whopping 14(?) characters, 7 normal characters and 7 tainted characters.[/b] Each team had to make a normal character over the span a few weeks, and then was given another team's character to make the tainted for. These characters include...

[*] [b]DoodleDude, Kerkel[/b] - Normal
[*] [b]Foks[/b] - Tainted
